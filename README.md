# tadam-maven-plugin

TADAM maven plugin, is just a small nofifier for your build. Every time the maven compilation finishes it just makes a build-in sound.

The plugin was inspired by my personal problem of kepping focus on the current task. On the other hand the compilation usually takes quite long, so I can get other things done at the same time. Usually that job is something I can pause, but I need to know when to do so.
So when my maven makes the sound when his job is done, I know that I can get back to the main task.
